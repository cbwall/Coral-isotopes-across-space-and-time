# Coral-isotopes-across-space-and-time
Reef corals are mixotrophic organisms relying on symbiont-derived photoautotrophy and water column heterotrophy. Coral endosymbionts (Family: Symbiodiniaceae), while typically considered mutualists, display a range of species-specific and environmentally mediated opportunism in their interactions with coral hosts, potentially requiring corals to rely more on heterotrophy to avoid declines in performance. To test the influence of symbiont communities on coral physiology (tissue biomass, symbiont density, photopigmentation) and nutrition (δ<sup>13</sup>C, δ<sup>15</sup>N), we sampled *Montipora capitata* colonies dominated by a specialist symbiont *Cladocopium* spp. or a putative opportunist *Durusdinium glynnii* (hereafter, C- or D-colonies) from Kāne‘ohe Bay, Hawai‘i, across gradients in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (1 - 10 m depth) during summer and winter.
